Serial Port Quick Name Popup

The application detects when a serial port is inserted and then displays a quick popup telling you which port number was assigned to it. This beats popping open devmgmt all day.


## Running

Currently this works best as an app that you start automically on startup. You will only be notified of serial insertions *after* this service has started.


There is code to run this as a service but it is half-backed and not at all functional.
